format via User Interface. Make sure that the application is masking sensitive user input by using the 
inputType="textPassword" attribute. It is useful to mitigate risks such as shoulder surfing.

/apks/wyze_SAST/resources/AndroidManifest.xml
grep: /apks/wyze_SAST/resources/AndroidManifest.xml: No such file or directory

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended that the appropriate Permission should be set via android:permission attribute with a 
proper android:protectionLevel in the AndroidManifest file, if observed. Please note that, The unprotected 
components can be invoked by other malicious applications and potentially access sensitive data or perform any of 
the privileged tasks possibly.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS: MSTG-PLATFORM-1 | CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

==>> The instances of Java Objects exposure through WebViews...


==>> The Object Persistence/Serialization instances...


==>> The WebViews Cleanup implementation...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended to clear the WebView resources when the application accesses any sensitive data within 
that, which may include any files stored locally, the RAM cache, and any loaded JavaScript. Please note that, this 
present a potential security risk if any sensitive data is being exposed.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS: MSTG-PLATFORM-10 | CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
    - https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/masvs/security-requirements/0x11-v6-interaction_with_the_environment

==>> The Application Update mechanism...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended that applications should be forced to be updated. If a security update comes in, then 
AppUpdateType.IMMEDIATE flag should be used in order to make sure that the user cannot go forward with using the 
app without updating it. Please note that, newer versions of an application will not fix security issues that are 
living in the backends to which the app communicates.

[*] Reference:
    - OWASP MASVS V1: MSTG-ARCH-9 | CWE-1277: Firmware Not Updateable

observed. Please note that, Code obfuscation in the applications protects against reverse engineering, tampering, 
or other attacks.

==>> The File Integrity Checks implementation...

[!] QuickNote:
    - It is recommended to implement CRC checks on the app bytecode, native libraries, and important data files, if 
not observed. Please note that, reverse engineers can easily bypass APK code signature check by re-packaging and 
re-signing an app. The idea is to have additional controls in place so that the app only runs correctly in its 
unmodified state, even if the code signature is valid.
